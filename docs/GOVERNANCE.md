# Governance — Agile AI Functional Elements

## Canonical Authority
The Agile AI Foundation maintains the canonical definition of
Agile AI Functional Elements.

## Change Policy
Changes to the Functional Elements are:
- Rare
- Intentional
- Explicitly versioned
- Backward-compatible where possible

## Versioning
- Minor clarifications: documentation updates only
- Semantic changes: new major version (v2.0, etc.)

## Authority
The English-language version hosted at agileai.foundation
is the authoritative reference.

## Scope
This governance applies only to definitions of the Functional Elements.
Learning, practices, assessments, and certifications are out of scope.
