# Changelog — Agile AI Functional Elements

This document records formal version declarations, institutional freeze points,
and operational infrastructure milestones for the Agile AI Functional Elements.

The Agile AI Functional Elements are governed as a stable, canonical reference.
Changes are rare, deliberate, and structurally controlled.

## v1.0 — Canonical Initial Release

Agile AI Functional Elements v1.0 establishes the canonical, framework-agnostic
definition of the six essential Functional Elements required for Agile AI systems.

This release defines *what must exist*, not practices, methods, tools,
certifications, or assessments.

The English version is the authoritative reference.

Date of initial publication: 2025-01-01

## v1.0 — Institutional Foundation Freeze

Tag: `v1.0-foundation-freeze`

This tag marks the formal institutional freeze of the v1.0 canonical structure.

At this freeze point:

- Governance Index authority boundaries were clarified.
- Archive structure was stabilized.
- Canonical authority language was hardened.
- Deprecated structural artifacts were intentionally removed.
- v1.0 was declared constitutionally stable.

This freeze establishes v1.0 as a long-term reference state.

No structural modifications to v1.0 canonical content are permitted
without a formally declared version increment.

Date of freeze: 2025-02-18

## Versioning Policy

- Minor clarifications (non-structural, non-semantic) may be recorded
  only if explicitly declared.
- Structural or definitional changes require a new version.
- Archived versions remain permanently accessible.
- Tags are immutable once published.
- Operational infrastructure changes must not alter canonical definitions.

Future versions (e.g., v1.1, v2.0) will be declared explicitly and
will not retroactively modify v1.0.

## 2026-02-18 — Institutional Measurement Layer Established

This entry records the introduction of non-invasive analytics instrumentation
across the governance surface.

Scope:

- GA4 (Measurement ID: G-B7RTGWC99E) implemented across all governance HTML pages.
- IP anonymization enabled.
- Referrer policy set to `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`.
- Aggregated measurement only.
- No personal data storage.
- No structural or semantic impact on canonical definitions.

The measurement layer constitutes operational infrastructure
and does not modify authority boundaries, version semantics,
or Functional Element definitions.

This layer is frozen under v1.0 governance unless formally revised.
