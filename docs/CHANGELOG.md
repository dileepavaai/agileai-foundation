# Changelog — Agile AI Functional Elements

## v1.0 — Initial Release

Agile AI Functional Elements v1.0 establishes the canonical, framework-agnostic definition of the six essential functional elements required for Agile AI systems. This release defines *what must exist*, not practices or methods, and is intended to remain stable over time. Future changes, if any, will be rare, deliberate, and backward-compatible where possible.
