# Changelog — Agile AI Functional Elements

This document records formal version declarations and institutional freeze points
for the Agile AI Functional Elements.

The Agile AI Functional Elements are governed as a stable, canonical reference.
Changes are rare, deliberate, and structurally controlled.

## v1.0 — Canonical Initial Release

Agile AI Functional Elements v1.0 establishes the canonical, framework-agnostic
definition of the six essential Functional Elements required for Agile AI systems.

This release defines *what must exist*, not practices, methods, tools,
certifications, or assessments.

The English version is the authoritative reference.

Date of initial publication: 2025-01-01

## v1.0 — Institutional Foundation Freeze

Tag: `v1.0-foundation-freeze`

This tag marks the formal institutional freeze of the v1.0 canonical structure.

At this freeze point:

- Governance Index authority boundaries were clarified.
- Archive structure was stabilized.
- Canonical authority language was hardened.
- Deprecated structural artifacts were intentionally removed.
- v1.0 was declared constitutionally stable.

This freeze establishes v1.0 as a long-term reference state.

No structural modifications to v1.0 canonical content are permitted
without a formally declared version increment.

Date of freeze: 2025-02-18

## Versioning Policy

- Minor clarifications (non-structural, non-semantic) may be recorded
  only if explicitly declared.
- Structural or definitional changes require a new version.
- Archived versions remain permanently accessible.
- Tags are immutable once published.

Future versions (e.g., v1.1, v2.0) will be declared explicitly and
will not retroactively modify v1.0.
