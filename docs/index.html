      <h1>Agile AI Functional Elements</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">Version 1.0 — Canonical Release</p>

      <p>
        Agile Artificial Intelligence (Agile AI) is defined by a small set of
        <strong>Functional Elements</strong>. These elements describe
        <strong>what must exist</strong> for AI-enabled products, projects, and
        services to be adaptive, responsible, and outcome-driven.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Agile AI Functional Elements are framework-agnostic,
        technology-neutral, and durable. They define essential capabilities —
        not practices, methods, tools, certifications, or assessments.
      </p>

      <p>
        These elements are <strong>governed, versioned, and maintained</strong>
        as a canonical reference. Their evolution is intentionally rare and
        controlled.

      <h2>The Six Agile AI Functional Elements</h2>

      <h3 id="intent-outcome">1. Intent &amp; Outcome Alignment</h3>
      <p>
        Agile AI systems must be explicitly aligned to clear intent and desired
        outcomes. AI capability exists to serve outcomes, not isolated outputs.
      </p>

      <h3 id="human-accountability">2. Human Judgment &amp; Accountability</h3>
      <p>
        Agile AI requires deliberate human judgment and clear accountability.
        Humans remain responsible for direction, constraints, and ethical decisions,
        even as automation and autonomy increase.
      </p>

      <h3 id="adaptive-execution">3. Adaptive Execution</h3>
      <p>
        Agile AI systems must continuously adapt based on feedback, learning,
        and emerging signals. Change is treated as a constant condition.
      </p>

      <h3 id="continuous-learning">4. Continuous Learning &amp; Feedback</h3>
      <p>
        Agile AI systems must learn continuously from outcomes, signals, and
        impacts across individual, team, system, and system-of-systems levels.
      </p>

      <h3 id="governance-design">5. Governance by Design</h3>
      <p>
        Governance is embedded intentionally into Agile AI systems.
        Ethical boundaries, constraints, and escalation paths are designed
        upfront and evolve with capability.
      </p>

      <h3 id="systemic-integration">6. Systemic Integration</h3>
      <p>
        Agile AI operates as part of a broader socio-technical system.
        Interdependencies and second-order effects are considered to avoid
        fragmentation and local optimization.

      <h2>Authority, Usage, and Interpretation Boundaries</h2>

      <p>
        This site (<strong>agileai.foundation</strong>) is the
        <strong>authoritative and canonical source</strong> for the definition
        of Agile AI Functional Elements.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Functional Elements define <strong>WHAT must exist</strong> for
        Agile AI to be operational. They are stable, versioned, and governed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Learning resources, training programs, tools, and assessments may
        <strong>apply</strong>, <strong>interpret</strong>, or
        <strong>evaluate alignment</strong> to these elements, but they do
        <strong>not redefine</strong> them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Insights, scores, or outcomes derived from assessments are reflective
        and contextual. They do not constitute certification, compliance,
        qualification, or modification of the Functional Elements.
      </p>

      <p>
        The authority flow is intentionally one-directional:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Foundation</strong> — defines and governs the Functional Elements</li>
        <li><strong>Learning</strong> — supports understanding and application</li>
        <li><strong>Assessment</strong> — provides reflective evaluation of alignment</li>
      </ul>
