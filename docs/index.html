      <h2>Canonical Status</h2>
      <p>
        This document represents the <strong>authoritative and canonical definition</strong> of
        Agile AI Functional Elements v1.0.
      </p>
      <p>
        Changes to this document are rare, deliberate, versioned, and governed.
        The English version is the authoritative reference.

      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>
        Agile Artificial Intelligence (Agile AI) is defined by a small set of
        Functional Elements. These elements describe <strong>what must exist</strong>
        for AI-enabled products, systems, and services to be adaptive,
        responsible, and outcome-driven.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Functional Elements are framework-agnostic, technology-neutral,
        and durable. They define essential capabilities — not practices,
        methods, tools, or certifications.
      </p>

      <h2>The Six Agile AI Functional Elements</h2>

      <h3>1. Intent &amp; Outcome Alignment</h3>
      <p>
        AI systems must be explicitly aligned to clear intent and desired
        outcomes. Capability exists to serve outcomes — not outputs.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Human Judgment &amp; Accountability</h3>
      <p>
        Agile AI requires deliberate human judgment and clear accountability.
        Humans remain responsible for direction, constraints, and ethical decisions.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Adaptive Execution</h3>
      <p>
        Agile AI systems continuously adapt based on feedback, learning,
        and emerging signals. Change is a constant condition.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Continuous Learning &amp; Feedback</h3>
      <p>
        Learning occurs across individual, team, system, and system-of-systems
        levels through outcomes, signals, and impacts.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Governance by Design</h3>
      <p>
        Governance is embedded intentionally into AI systems. Ethical boundaries,
        constraints, and escalation paths are designed upfront.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Systemic Integration</h3>
      <p>
        Agile AI operates within broader socio-technical systems.
        Interdependencies and second-order effects are explicitly considered.
      </p>

        Practices, learning resources, assessments, and certifications may reference
        these elements but must not redefine them.

      <h2>About the Agile AI Foundation</h2>
      <p>
        The Agile AI Foundation exists to preserve a clear, stable, and neutral
        definition of Agile AI Functional Elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Foundation does not provide training, certification, or assessments.
        Learning and application resources are maintained separately.
